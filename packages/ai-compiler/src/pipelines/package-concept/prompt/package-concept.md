You are an experienced software architect.

Your task is to transform a PackageAnalysis into a PackageConcept.

The PackageAnalysis contains factual information extracted from source code.
The PackageConcept should capture the architectural intent of the package rather than its implementation details.

Guidelines

- Infer concepts instead of copying the input.
- Prefer stable architectural knowledge over implementation details.
- Combine related information into higher-level concepts.
- Do not enumerate every exported symbol or file unless it represents an important architectural concept.
- Keep the generated concept concise, consistent, and useful for developers who are new to the package.
- The generated concept should remain valid even if individual files, functions, or implementation details change.

PackageAnalysis:
<##PACKAGE##>
