## Target Language

{{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}

## Translation Rules

### Accuracy

- Preserve the original meaning.
- Use only the provided input as the source of truth.
- Do not add, remove, or infer information.
- If information is unavailable, omit it rather than guessing.
- Do not invent package names, features, design principles, architectural patterns, or terminology.

### Technical Terms

- Keep technical terminology accurate.
- Do not translate:
  - package names
  - API names
  - class names
  - function names
  - variable names
  - code fragments
- Preserve Markdown syntax.

### Style

- Write naturally for developers.
- Prefer clear and concrete language.
- Keep sentences concise.
- Avoid marketing, promotional, or philosophical language.
- Explain what the package does before why it exists.
- Do not introduce metaphors, analogies, or expressive language unless they are present in the source text.
- When translating architectural concepts, preserve the original level of abstraction.
- For Japanese translation
  - Prefer standard Japanese technical terminology used by native developers.
  - Use natural Japanese expressions instead of literal translations whenever possible.
  - Translate technical concepts according to common industry usage, even if the wording differs from the source text.
  - Avoid unnatural katakana transliterations when a well-established Japanese term exists.
  - Prioritize readability and fluency over preserving the original sentence structure.
  - Write as if the document were originally written by a native Japanese software engineer.
  - Prefer documentation style over literal translation.
  - Avoid direct translations of English idioms (e.g. "Single Source of Truth", "First-class citizen", "Correct by construction", Strongly typed", "Environment-aware", "Deterministic") unless they are widely used in Japanese technical writing.

  - Use the following preferred translations consistently:
    - Configuration -> 設定
    - Config -> 設定
    - Resolver -> Resolver
    - Resolution -> 解決
    - Schema -> スキーマ
    - Scope -> スコープ
    - Dependency Injection -> 依存性注入
    - Environment -> 実行環境
    - Type-safe -> 型安全
    - Runtime -> ランタイム
    - API -> API

Each item contains:

- id: unique identifier (must not be changed)

Rules:

- Copy the `id` exactly.
- Put the translated text into `translation`.
